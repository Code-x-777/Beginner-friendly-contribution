Introduction 📚

This guide is designed to help beginners make their first contribution to the "beginner friendly-contribution" repository. If you're new to open source and want to contribute to this project, follow these steps to get started. 🌈
Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository 🍴

    Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. 🍽️
    Copy the URL of your forked repository. 🔗
    Open your terminal and use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine using the copied URL. 💻

Step 2: Update the "heros.md" File ✍️

    Navigate to the root of the cloned repository. 📂

    Open the "heros.md" file in your text editor. 📝

    Find the last <td> tag in the file and copy it. 📋

    Paste the copied <td> tag directly underneath the last one (you can use ALT+SHIFT+down arrow for this). 🔄

    Modify the information within this new <td> tag to match your own GitHub profile. Update the <a> tag, image tag, and name as needed. ✨

    Note: If you see four existing <td> tags under one <tr> tag, you cannot add another <td> within the same <tr>. In this case, create a new <tr> tag and add your desired <td> within it. 🚧

Step 3: Update the Contributors Array 📄

    Navigate to the "script" folder and open the "script.js" file. 📁
    Inside the "contributors" array, you will find a list of contributors. Copy the last object in the array. 📋
    Paste the copied object at the end of the array. 🚶
    Replace the "name" field with your GitHub username and the "github" field with your GitHub URL. 🌐

Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes 🚢

    In your terminal (inside the repository folder), initialize a Git repository using the command git init. 🔄
    Add your changes to the Git staging area with git add .. ➕
    Create a commit with a meaningful message, for example: git commit -m "Added my first contribution". 📦
    Push your changes to your forked repository using git push. 🚀

Step 5: Create a Pull Request 🔄

    Go to your forked repository on GitHub. 🌐
    Click the "New Pull Request" button. 🔄
    Review your changes, provide a descriptive title and comment if necessary, then click "Create Pull Request". 📤
