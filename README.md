## Introduction 📚

This repository is designed to help beginners make their first contribution to open source projects. If you're new to open source and want to contribute to this project, follow these steps to get started. 🌈

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository 🍴

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. 🍽️
2. Copy the URL of your forked repository. 🔗
3. Open your terminal and use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine using the copied URL. 💻

### Step 2: Update the "heroes.md" File ✍️

1. Navigate to the root of the cloned repository. 📂
2. Open the "heroes.md" file in your text editor. 📝
3. Find the last `<td>` tag in the file and copy it. 📋
4. Paste the copied `<td>` tag directly underneath the last one (you can use ALT+SHIFT+down arrow for this). 🔄
5. Modify the information within this new `<td>` tag to match your own GitHub profile. Update the `<a>` tag, image tag, and name as needed. ✨
   
   Note: If you see four existing `<td>` tags under one `<tr>` tag, you cannot add another `<td>` within the same `<tr>`. In this case, create a new `<tr>` tag and add your desired `<td>` within it. 🚧

### Step 3: Update the Contributors Array 📄

1. Navigate to the "script" folder and open the "script.js" file. 📁
2. Inside the "contributors" array, you will find a list of contributors. Copy the last object in the array. 📋
3. Paste the copied object at the end of the array. 🚶
4. Replace the "name" field with your GitHub username and the "github" field with your GitHub URL. 🌐

### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes 🚢

1. In your terminal (inside the repository folder), initialize a Git repository using the command `git init`. 🔄
2. Add your changes to the Git staging area with `git add .`. ➕
3. Create a commit with a meaningful message, for example: `git commit -m "Added my first contribution"`. 📦
4. Push your changes to your forked repository using `git push`. 🚀

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request 🔄

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub. 🌐
2. Click the "New Pull Request" button. 🔄
3. Review your changes, provide a descriptive title and comment if necessary, then click "Create Pull Request". 📤
